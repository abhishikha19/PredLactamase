# PredLactamase
Predlactamase is a SVM based two-level prediction system for multiclass prediction and classification of β-lactamase.
In this work we have developed SVM based two level prediction method,which differentiate β-lactamases from non β-lactamase at first level 
and classify β-lactamases into different class at second level.
At first level we were able to classify β-lactamases from non β-lactamases with 90.63% accuracy.
At second level we found maximum accuracy of 61.82%, 89.09%, 70.91% and 74.55% of class A, class B, class C and class D respectively.
A web-server and standalone of PredLactamase has also been developed  which can be accessed at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/predlactamase/.
